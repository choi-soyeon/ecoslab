#### **<mark>FOR POTENTIAL GRADUATE STUDENTS (MASTER'S, PHD)</mark>**
<blockquote style="font-size:1rem; font-style:normal;">
If you’re thinking about applying to join the ECoS lab, I’m most interested in working with students who are (1) excited about research ideas, (2) conscientious, and (3) comfortable learning as you go. Since the lab is new, there isn’t a single “right” fit. I’m open to different directions as long as your interests connect with <a href="{{ '/publications/' | relative_url }}">the kinds of questions I study</a>. If you’re interested, please email me a short note with your background and the research ideas you’re most excited to pursue. Here’s a <a href="https://psychsci.yonsei.ac.kr/%EB%8C%80%ED%95%99%EC%9B%90">link</a> to Yonsei’s graduate program.

#### **<mark>FOR POTENTIAL UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH ASSISTANTS</mark>**
<blockquote style="font-size:1rem; font-style:normal;">
For Spring and Summer 2026, I’m looking for undergraduate research assistants who (1) have taken coursework in social and/or evolutionary psychology and (2) are familiar with using R. Starting in Fall 2026, I’ll be recruiting students for a wider range of roles, including literature reviews, preparing study materials, and helping with data collection.
